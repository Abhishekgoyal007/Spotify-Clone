# Spotify-Clone
This project is a front-end clone of Spotify using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a responsive layout, a sidebar for navigation (Home, Search, Your Library), and a main area for recently played and trending tracks. It includes a sticky nav bar and a fixed music player with standard controls at the bottom.
